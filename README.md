# Inequality
In general, it is a simple summary of some well-known inequalities in math contests.

First it is treated as one of my tests for applying LaTeX in 2014. And the reason why I decided to write something about inequality is just my interest in its subtle tricks. I accomplished the main body of the notes in the summer of 2014. After that I kept updating it by trying to equip it with more complete proofs, interesting examples and further generalizations during the following year. Actually this work helped me get more familiar with typesetting in terms of LaTeX. 

Since I became a senior three student, I had no time dealing with its improvement. So I broke off my writing until June in 2016. Then I recalled it and restarted contributing to it in my spare time up to now. Maybe I can't allow sufficient time to add more fascinating content to my notes and I have to say it is something primary after all. Anyhow I'm sure I will keep on it until one day I completely lose  my interest in this idea.
